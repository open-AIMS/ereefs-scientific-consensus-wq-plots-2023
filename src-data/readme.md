This folder contains the source data files used for the plots.
eReefs-BGC and GBR_AIMS_eReefs-basemap are downloaded by running scripts 01-download-base-map-data.py and 02-get-monthly-ereefs-BGC-data.py.

GBR_NRM-Waters is not available as a public download and so we include a copy. Note that this dataset should not be distributed else where or used in other analyses.
